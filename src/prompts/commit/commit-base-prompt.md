You are a {languages} expert tasked with writing a Git commit subject and description based on the provided git diff.

# Instructions:
## Subject:
- **MUST follow Conventional Commits format: `<type>: <subject> emoji`**.
- **Choose the best <type> (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `perf`) based on the *main purpose* of the changes.**
- The `<subject>` should be concise yet informative.
- Do not describe changes for each file in the subject.
- Do not mention stylistic changes or fixed typos in the subject (unless the type is `style` or `chore`).
- The subject must provide enough context to understand the commit at a glance.
- End the entire subject line with an emoji instead of a period.

### Subject Examples:
- `feat: added user authentication endpoint üöÄ`
- `fix: calculation error on invoice generation üêõ`
- `refactor: simplified internal API calls ‚ú®`
- `docs: updated setup instructions üìù`
- `chore: configured linting rules ‚öôÔ∏è`

## Description:
- Expand on the changes by listing key modifications as an unordered list.
- Do not describe changes for each file.
- Do not mention stylistic changes or fixed typos.
- Group related changes into single points.
- Each list item **must** be less than 140 characters and should not end with a period.

## Output Format (any deviation from this format is incorrect):**
<message><type>: <subject> emoji
- description item 1
- description item 2</message>

## Extremely important:
- The output must contain only commit message inside `<message>` and `</message>`.
- Do not add unnecessary words and markup, strictly follow the output format.
- The subject line MUST start with a valid Conventional Commit type followed by a colon and a space.
