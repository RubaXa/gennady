# Authoring trajectory baseline

Source: 990131fbc83c07576b0ae70b4f2e10abdd1d658b; model: llm-proxy/deepseek-v4-flash. Recorded 1/6.

Baseline only — no prompt, speed or quality improvement is claimed.

| Case | Saved/planned | Artifact | Semantic | Joint | Path proven | Tools median | Reads | Writes/edits | Bash | Repeated reads | Worker tokens* | Worker messages | Worker seconds |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| module-flat | 1/3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 25 | 12 | 2 | 11 | 0 | 50483 (1/3) | 20 | 91.7 |
| module-nested | 0/3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown | unknown (0/3) | unknown | unknown |

*Non-cache tokens. Per-role input/output/reasoning/cache counters are in report.json. Cost and provider HTTP retries are unknown.

- A baseline only: no optimization or causal speedup has been demonstrated.
- Artifact, semantic and path verdicts are separate; opaque Bash is not proof of a forbidden write.
- Read/write counts are attempts, not bytes read or filesystem changes. An observed repeat is not necessarily waste.
- Token totals exclude cache reads; cache counters and model messages are separate in per-role profiles.
- SDK REST requests include polling and are not provider HTTP calls; proxy retries and monetary cost are unknown.
- Three repetitions describe these synthetic artifact cases, not statistical equivalence or the complete interactive SDD flow.

Artifact=true; semantic=pass; path=false; status=completed.

Failed artifact checks: none. Path detail: opaque Bash command: whole-write-only path unproven.

Binding/capture/cleanup issues: none. SDK REST measurement requests (including polling): unknown.

Categories below describe observable actions, not private reasoning or proven necessity. Read/write rows are attempts; status/exit retain failures. Withheld shell payloads remain unknown, never guessed.
