# Authoring trajectory baseline

Source: 67326bc51786cd548b2334e4e5fbcb4a9bc66c53; model: llm-proxy/deepseek-v4-flash. Recorded 12/12.

Baseline only — no prompt, speed or quality improvement is claimed.

| Case | Saved/planned | Artifact | Semantic | Joint | Path proven | Tools median | Reads | Writes/edits | Bash | Repeated reads | Worker tokens* | Worker messages | Worker seconds |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| module-flat | 6/6 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 18.5 | 10 | 1 | 7 | 0 | 39535.5 (6/6) | 13 | 71.4 |
| module-nested | 6/6 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 21.5 | 10.5 | 1 | 9.5 | 0 | 46307.5 (6/6) | 15 | 79.0 |

*Non-cache tokens. Per-role input/output/reasoning/cache counters are in report.json. Cost and provider HTTP retries are unknown.

- A baseline only: no optimization or causal speedup has been demonstrated.
- Artifact, semantic and path verdicts are separate; opaque Bash is not proof of a forbidden write.
- Read/write counts are attempts, not bytes read or filesystem changes. An observed repeat is not necessarily waste.
- Token totals exclude cache reads; cache counters and model messages are separate in per-role profiles.
- SDK REST requests include polling and are not provider HTTP calls; proxy retries and monetary cost are unknown.
- Three repetitions describe these synthetic artifact cases, not statistical equivalence or the complete interactive SDD flow.

Categories below describe observable actions, not private reasoning or proven necessity. Read/write rows are attempts; status/exit retain failures. Withheld shell payloads remain unknown, never guessed.
